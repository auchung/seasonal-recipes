# seasonal-recipes

This is a project for DSC 80 at UCSD.

## Step 1: Introduction & Dataset

In this project, we explore a dataset of online recipe submissions, reviews, and nutritional facts.  
Our goal is to analyze patterns in recipe ratings, nutrition, preparation steps, and more.

We begin by cleaning the data, identifying missing values, and constructing helpful derived columns such as `high_rating` and `interaction_date` to support later analyses.
